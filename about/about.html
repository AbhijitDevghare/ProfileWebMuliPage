                <p>What I say , He is my biggest inspiration . One of the reason is that he helps me to heal when I am sad. I listen his songs and feel better . Another reason is that he is a good person . I don't like him only because he is the <b><u>best singer </u></b>, I like him because he lives simple life and helps needy people. He runs the <b><u>Tatwamasi Foundation</u></b>
                that helps needy ones. This Foundation makes hospital, schools so that the poor people have these facilities in a very very low cost.
